            <div class="col-sm-6"><p class="center-text">Within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public 
                repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month alone. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been 
                forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged. GitHub continued to release products including GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, RedCarpet, 
                and Hubot. Many companies that now regularly use GitHub – including Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Google – joined GitHub during this period. 
                GitHub grows significantly, receiving $100 million in a series of inventment and growing revenue at 300% annually. In that time period GitHub 
                stated that they had reached 100,000 users, hosted 2 million repositories hosted, and had 139 employees. Ruby and JavaScript became the most popular 
                languages on GitHub, with 19% and 17% of the hosted code, respectively.</p></div>
